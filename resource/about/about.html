                    <p>Team WayGrow is a small, well-traveled team of three explorers who’ve worked our way up the
                        ladder from the entry level front lines of seasonal work to positions in upper management.
                        We’ve been in the industry long enough to understand that career paths can change, grow, morph,
                        and evolve as they unfold. Our personal adventures have taught us that great places lead to
                        great experiences.
                        Though each member of Team WayGrow has a unique backstory and home base, we are united in the
                        shared joy
                        of the work we get to do. CoolWorks.com has been in existence since sometime, and every day, we
                        celebrate the
                        opportunity to help job seekers find life-changing opportunities like the ones that shaped our
                        own stories. <br> <br>

                        At WayGrow, we believe that life is made of moments, and the best moments are when we feel
                        connected to something bigger
                        than ourselves. Connection sparks joy, and connecting with our community brings us immense joy!
